# BTC-Rregression-Model
Build a BTC prediction(not exactly) model from related financial indicators.

## Is this reliable?
I don't think so. But you can take it as reference.

## How to use it?
### Python
Download the latest Spyder and run it. I think it shoud be fine with CLI as well. Don't for get to install the packages first, which are `sklearn`, `pandas`, `NumPy`, `matplot` and `statsmodels`.

### R
Download the latest R Studio and run it. Don't forget to install packages used by the script first, which are `caret`, `NLP`, `xlsx` and `DescTools`.

## Credits
Python script is done by 鄭適其. I (@idoleat) convert it to R.
